# Database Setup Guide for Render Deployment

## Current Issue
Data disappears on Render deployment because the database connection or transactions aren't persisting properly.

## Solution Files Created

### 1. `init_db.py` - Database Initialization Script
- Creates all necessary tables
- Populates default users and categories
- Verifies database connection
- Runs during build process

### 2. Updated `build.sh` - Enhanced Build Script
- Now runs database initialization after package installation
- Ensures database is properly set up before deployment

### 3. Enhanced `app.py` - Better Error Handling
- Added comprehensive database logging
- Better error handling for database operations
- Proper PostgreSQL URL format handling

### 4. Improved `routes.py` - Transaction Logging
- Added logging for all database operations
- Better error handling and rollback logic

## Files to Upload to GitHub

Replace these files:
- `init_db.py` (NEW FILE)
- `build.sh` (UPDATED)
- `app.py` (UPDATED)
- `routes.py` (UPDATED)

## What This Fixes

1. **Database Connection**: Ensures PostgreSQL URL format is correct
2. **Table Creation**: Guarantees all tables exist before app starts
3. **Default Data**: Creates users and categories if they don't exist
4. **Transaction Logging**: Tracks all database operations
5. **Error Handling**: Better rollback and error recovery

## After Deployment

The build logs on Render will show:
- Database initialization status
- Number of users and categories created
- Any connection errors

This should resolve the data persistence issue completely.
